# Notes on Neovim configuration

This is in a markdown file.

API so its picking up my spelling files

Need to make this a similar to my Vim setup

## Improvements

- Better file explorer
- Telescope for file/search/lookup
  - `<leader ss>` for symbol search
- Nice conceal support for markdown

-

## Fixes

- `Supertab` like thing working with LSP
-

## What are the differences

- Snippets are controlled by LSP
- Python ruff?

## TODO

- missing \` for markdown mode
- Search? Something is working differently here. Flash?
- Spelling for completions
- localvimrc
